## Description  

This application makes calls to a server API, in this case both Open Weather 'onecall' and the Open Weather 'Weather' API and using these to get the current weather and a future weather forecast for input cities. A user can enter the name of a city in the search bar and updates the webpage with the current and future weather data and update the search history. When the weather data is shown, it shows the current city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index, and below a 5 day weather forecast with future weather in each smaller card. When a button in search history is clicked, the weather data for that city is shown on the webpage. Upon reloading the webpage, the search history is saved and is rendered to the screen under 'search history'. For the UV index, the background colour changed depending on the value of the index.
